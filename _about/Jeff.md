My name is Jeffrey Adkisson, and I'd like to introduce myself. I am a first-year student at Shaw University majoring in Computer Information Systems. I'm a student athlete who participates in Shaw University Menâ€™s soccer and track and field. Not only am I a student athlete, but I am also the chair of the forthcoming Men Initiative, a member of the Mental and Physical Health Organization, and a member of the National Leadership and Success Group on campus. After receiving my bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems, I intend to start my own cyber security firm.
