Hello my name is Khalil Warner a junior computer science major at Shaw University. I am a member of the all in program for the fall and spring that involves both GitHub and major league hacking, I also was nominated for the Alpha Chi national honor society for the grades and maintaining gpa of 3.2.For me my story starts from when I was a sophomore in high school doing graphic design in one of my classes that lead to doing multiple adobe projects, with brought to my presence allowed me to gain a more top level understanding of the matter. I also start doing research outside of the classroom through my highschool career that impacted my mindset. I actually was heavy into track as a career making it to states and everything and also going to pro events but I would say god had other plans for my future.
